## Companion Plugin: Elayne Blocks

Elayne works seamlessly with the **[Elayne Blocks](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne-blocks)** plugin, which provides custom Gutenberg blocks that enhance the theme's capabilities. While these blocks were designed as companions to the Elayne theme, they are **theme-agnostic** and work with any WordPress theme.

### Why a Separate Plugin?

WordPress.org Theme Review requirements prohibit custom block registration in themes. By separating blocks into a plugin, we ensure compliance while providing powerful functionality that works across any theme.

### Available Blocks

The Elayne Blocks plugin includes **4 custom blocks**:

1. **Mega Menu Block** - Advanced navigation with mega menu functionality, WordPress Interactivity API integration, and keyboard navigation
2. **Carousel Block** - Responsive image/content carousel with Slick Carousel integration and touch/swipe support
3. **Slide Block** - Individual carousel slides with InnerBlocks support for flexible content
4. **FAQ Tabs Block** - Interactive FAQ with vertical tab navigation and customizable buttons

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the plugin repository
cd wp-content/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/imagewize/elayne-blocks.git

# Or download from GitHub releases
# Activate via WordPress admin: Plugins → Elayne Blocks → Activate
```
