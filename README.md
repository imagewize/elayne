## Companion Plugin: Elayne Blocks

Elayne works seamlessly with the **[Elayne Blocks](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne-blocks)** plugin, which provides 4 custom blocks: Mega Menu, Carousel, Slide, and FAQ Tabs. While designed as companions to Elayne, these blocks are **theme-agnostic** and work with any WordPress theme.

WordPress.org Theme Review requirements prohibit custom block registration in themes, so blocks are provided via a separate plugin for compliance while maintaining powerful functionality.

Download from the [Elayne Blocks repository](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne-blocks) and install via **Plugins → Add New → Upload Plugin**.
