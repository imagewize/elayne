## Companion Plugin: Elayne Blocks

Elayne works seamlessly with the **[Elayne Blocks](https://github.com/imagewize/elayne-blocks)** plugin, which provides custom Gutenberg blocks that enhance the theme's capabilities. While these blocks were designed as companions to the Elayne theme, they are **theme-agnostic** and work with any WordPress theme.

### Why a Separate Plugin?

WordPress.org Theme Review requirements prohibit custom block registration in themes. By separating blocks into a plugin, we ensure compliance while providing powerful functionality that works across any theme.

### Available Blocks

The Elayne Blocks plugin includes **4 custom blocks**:

1. **Mega Menu Block** (`elayne/mega-menu`)
   - Advanced navigation with mega menu functionality
   - WordPress Interactivity API integration
   - Template part support for dynamic content
   - Keyboard navigation and responsive design

2. **Carousel Block** (`elayne/carousel`)
   - Responsive image/content carousel
   - Slick Carousel integration
   - Customizable settings and breakpoints
   - Touch/swipe support

3. **Slide Block** (`elayne/slide`)
   - Individual carousel slides
   - InnerBlocks support for flexible content
   - Works seamlessly with Carousel parent block

4. **FAQ Tabs Block** (`elayne/faq-tabs`)
   - Interactive FAQ with vertical tab navigation
   - Dynamic content display with answers
   - Customizable button with configurable text and URL
   - WordPress Interactivity API integration

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the plugin repository
cd wp-content/plugins/
git clone https://github.com/imagewize/elayne-blocks.git
